# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?
I think just the problem solving itself was difficult, i struglled on coming up witha concept of how to apporach this problem, but looking at Mr.Bergs soultions and how he did it was very usefull and helped me approach it the way he did. I think next time i will try what he did wich is writting the problem out on paper and tying to visualize it.
2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.
I think using a diffrent verations of the game where the computer plays a certian set of moves depending on how the human player acts, this could be doen with maybe an ai or just writing indivsual code for each possible move by the player, this may be very time consuming though.
3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.
I would approach this by using data to see how to win tic tac toe evrey time, and write code that makes the computer play the best move. This would also mean that the computer goes first because if you play tic tac toe and you go first you can if you know how only win or tie, there is no possible loss.
